# Dataset Setup – CERT Insider Threat Dataset

## Overview

This project uses the **CERT Insider Threat Test Dataset** provided by the
**Software Engineering Institute (SEI), Carnegie Mellon University** for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Due to the **large size**, **licensing restrictions**, and **academic usage policies** of the dataset, it is **not included directly in this GitHub repository**.
Instead, users are required to download the dataset from the **official source** and place the required files locally.

---

## Official Dataset Source

**CERT Insider Threat Test Dataset (Official Repository):**
[https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247)

This is the **only official and trusted source** for the dataset.



## Required Dataset Files

For this project, only a **small subset** of the CERT dataset is required.

After downloading and extracting `r1.tar.bz2`, ensure the following files are present:

```
r1/
├── logon.csv     # User login and logout activity
├── device.csv    # USB and removable device usage
├── http.csv      # Web browsing activity
└── LDAP/         # User and organizational metadata (optional)
```

These files are sufficient to implement:

* Behavioral analytics
* Feature extraction
* Machine learning–based anomaly detection

---

## Why These Files Are Required

| File         | Purpose                                         |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `logon.csv`  | Detect abnormal login times and access patterns |
| `device.csv` | Identify suspicious USB usage                   |
| `http.csv`   | Analyze unusual web activity                    |
| `LDAP/`      | Map users to roles and departments              |

This subset keeps the project **lightweight**, **practical**, and **academically valid**.

## Dataset Download Steps

1. Visit the official CMU Kilthub page:
   [https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247)

2. Download:

   * `r1.tar.bz2`

3. Extract the archive:

   ```bash
   tar -xvjf r1.tar.bz2
   ```

4. Copy the extracted `r1` folder into:

   ```
   project_root/data/
   ```

Final structure:

```
SPi/
├── data/
│   └── r1/
│       ├── logon.csv
│       ├── device.csv
│       ├── http.csv
│       └── LDAP/
├── feature_extraction.py
├── anomaly_detection.py
└── README.md
```

## Reason for Excluding Dataset from GitHub

* Dataset size exceeds GitHub limits (multiple GB)
* Academic research usage restrictions
* Ethical and legal compliance
* Standard industry and research practice

Including this README ensures the project remains:
✔ Reproducible
✔ Ethical
✔ Exam-safe
✔ Resume-ready
